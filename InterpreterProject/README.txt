Directory Structure
1.  Algorithm -- classes used to execute operations such as +,-,/,*,=, etc...
2.  Driver    -- classes that are used to encapsulate the Parser and Scanner
3.  Functions -- built-in functions that perform operations such as stack and sort
4.  Grammar --   files that house the production grammar and tokens for this interpreter
5.  Log --		 files for the logging facility
6.  Nodes --     files that represent the Node hierarchy for this interpreter
7.  Tables --    files for the symbol and function table
8.  TestFiles -- files that contain commands to test the interpreter commands
9.  Values    -- files that represent arrays, integers, floats, and strings
10. Visitors  -- files that visit the Nodes

There's more left to do!
1.  Better error messages from functions that contain errors.
2.  String utilities
    - len
    - cmp
    - find
    - slicing
    - indexing
3.  Improved File IO
    - general fread() function to read data from a file.
4.  Functions:  void return values vs not.
